The excuted code (CPU version) of the paper "Video Saliency Detection via Spatial-Temporal Fusion and Low-Rank Coherency Diffusion"

Notice: Due to the compatibility, we only provide the CPU verision. Thus, the computation might be little time consuming, and the CUDA implementation is almost 20 times faster than the CPU version.
